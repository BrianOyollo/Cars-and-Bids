It gets better: this Bronco has undergone a manual transmission swap, making it more engaging to drive (and likely a bit more responsive) \u2013 and it boasts the Bronco's larger 5.8-liter V8, too.

I want this car, and I'm jealous of whoever ends up with it.",

One-owner W126 models are basically impossible to find now, so this is a rare treat.",

He explains that he bought this car as a trophy after taking his company public. He provides additional details in a video titled \"The Story\" that's embedded below.",

            "Air conditioning, a catalytic converter, and an American-spec instrument cluster were installed before this 280SE left Germany. The odometer shows 131,310 miles, but the seller states it stopped working less than 100 miles ago after he reset the trip meter.",
            "Modifications made to this 280SE include a newer Alpine CD player. It's equipped with 14-inch wheels, wood interior trim, and a sunroof, among other features, and it still wears the desirable European-spec lights and bumpers on both ends.",
            "Mercedes-Benz introduced the W126 in Germany in 1979, though American sales didn't start until the 1981 model year, and it expanded the range during the 1980s. 6- and 8-cylinder models were offered, plus long- and short-wheelbase variants and a coupe called C126 internally. Available from 1979 to 1985, the short-wheelbase and fuel-injected 280SE was positioned near the bottom of the range. It was never officially sold in America, making it a rare sight that's sought-after by enthusiasts.",

            "The seller states he's an auto technician, and that he has worked on this Touareg himself since purchasing it. He adds that major work performed during his ownership includes replacing the camshafts, the fuel pumps, the water pump, many of the cooling system's hoses, both batteries, plus numerous seals and gaskets, and repairing the keyless entry unit. Most of the repairs done are detailed in a video below.",
            "Modifications made to this Touareg include a Stage 1 tune from RocketChip. The seller also notes the diesel particulate filters have been gutted, the standard suspension height has been lowered, and the EGR valve and related piping have been removed.",
            "Volkswagen introduced the Touareg, its first modern SUV, for the 2004 model year. Part of the brand's upmarket push, it was related to the original Porsche Cayenne, and it was marketed as a true off-roader packed with luxury features; many compared it to the Range Rover. It could cross rivers, tow a boat, or cruise on the highway for hours on end. The V10 TDI-powered model was positioned at the top of the Touareg range in the United States, where the mighty W12 engine was never available.",
            "Power for this Touareg comes from a 5.0-liter TDI turbodiesel V10, which produces 310 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque when unmodified. The seller states the RocketChip Stage 1 tune bumps those figures up to 340 and 590, respectively, though a dyno sheet wasn't provided. The engine spins the 4 wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission and Volkswagen's 4Motion permanent all-wheel-drive system, and it gives the Touareg a pickup-like 7,700-pound towing capacity."

The rear-wheel-drive four-seater was smaller and lighter than the 3 Series coupe and at launch was offered as the 230-horsepower 128i or the 300-horsepower 135i. The 1 Series is beloved by enthusiasts today for its small size, aftermarket support, and traditional rear-wheel-drive BMW driving characteristics.",

It was a burly, body-on-frame off-roader with a 40-degree approach angle and nearly 10 inches of ground clearance. The boxy body hid tried-and-true parts borrowed from Chevrolet's Suburban and Tahoe SUVs and modified for off-road use. H2 production ended in 2009.",

Most sources agree about 500 units of the H2 Victory Red were made. Pricing started at $66,030, which made it nearly $12,000 more expensive than the regular H2.",

It's currently located in Vancouver, and its odometer shows about 98,000 miles. The Carfax report shown in the gallery confirms this accident-free history.",
            "The original window sticker also included in the gallery reveals this M3 cost $41,855 new, which represents about $70,000 in 2020. Optional extras include an M rear wing, a power-operated sunroof, and cruise control.",
            "Modifications made to this M3 include a Ground Control coilover kit, Vorshlag engine and transmission mounts, a Stewart Components water pump with a metal impeller, a Mishimoto radiator, and an AFE cold-air intake. The full list of aftermarket parts installed on this car is below, and some of the factory parts are included in the sale.",
            "Service records shown in the gallery detail most of the maintenance, repairs, and modifications performed on this M3 since it was imported to Canada in 1997. The power steering fluid reservoir, two power steering hoses, the coolant level sensor, and the battery are among the parts replaced in 2020.",
            "BMW introduced the E36-generation M3 as a coupe for the 1995 model year, and it expanded the range with a sedan and a convertible in 1997 and 1998, respectively. It was bigger than its predecessor, the original E30-based model, but it remained quick and engaging to drive so demand quickly ballooned. 11,793 units of the M3 coupe were sold in America from 1996 to 1999, according to BMW's archives department.",
            "Power for this M3 comes from the \"S52\" 3.2-liter straight-6, which produces 240 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. It spins the rear wheels via a 5-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential."

Styled by Pininfarina, it was developed as a true luxury sedan that was longer than a BMW 7 Series, wider than a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, powered by an exotic V8, and loaded to the gills with luxury and technology features.",
            "Maserati never envisioned the Quattroporte as a high-volume model. It sold 10,639 units of the sedan globally between 2003, when sales started, and 2008, when an updated model made its debut. America was one of its largest markets.",

            "Originally the name for a mountain pass, and now an Alfa Romeo, the Stelvio moniker briefly denoted a Zagato-designed, Nissan-based luxury coupe built in strictly limited numbers. Its hand-built aluminum body hides a chassis shared with the upmarket \"F31\" Leopard, which was sold as the Infiniti M30 in the United States, while its fiberglass hood covers a turbocharged engine tuned by Autech, a subsidiary Nissan created to customize its cars.",
            "Historians disagree about the number of Stelvio AZ1s built between 1989 and 1992. Some claim 88 units were made, while others peg the true figure at 104. Regardless, this is number 56. It cost roughly 18 million yen \u2014 twice the price of a Honda NSX \u2014 when new.",
            "Rarity and Italian design alone couldn't justify such a high price, so the Stelvio AZ1 was lavishly equipped. It featured leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver's seat, cruise control, and a Bose sound system, among other equipment.",
            "Power for this Stelvio AZ1 comes from a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6, which produces 280 horsepower and 276 lb-ft of torque. Built by Nissan and tuned by Autech, the engine spins the rear wheels via a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive."

This is a 1995 Jaguar XJR, which is already a reasonably cool car, but then this one has had its 4-speed automatic swapped out for a 5-speed manual. And that manual came from an Aston Martin DB7. What a swap that is, and what a car to do it with, as the lazy automatic was always the weak link with these cars. I have no idea what this is worth, but I'm sure someone will relish the idea of rowing their own gears in a Jaguar sedan \u2013 and here's your chance to do it with no reserve on Cars & Bids.",

It launched with a supercharged straight-6 engine, and it also received larger exhaust tips, specific wheels, and a mesh grille insert to stand out from other XJs. Priced at $65,000 when it was new (about $111,000 in 2020), the XJR was positioned well into Mercedes-Benz S-Class territory.",

Envisioned as an Italian TVR, it was styled by Marcello Gandini and its development was largely funded by the Qvale family. De Tomaso later renamed the car Mangusta (a name first used from 1967 to 1971), but it exited the partnership shortly after production began in late 1999, allegedly due to a disagreement. Bruce Qvale put his name on the Mangusta at the last minute to recoup his investment.",

Of course, this only makes it cool, especially for car enthusiasts who love the weird stuff; this is definitely very weird, and in a wonderfully good way.

It's also equipped with wood interior trim, heated and ventilated front seats, plus a Bose sound system.",

Several top hydraulic cylinders, the Active Body Control (ABC) pump, the power steering pump, and the driver-side rear suspension ballast were notably replaced in the past couple of years.

It was appreciably quicker and far more advanced than its predecessor, it ditched the boxy lines for a sleeker and more rounded design, and it came standard with a power-retractable hardtop. 2009 brought a round of comprehensive updates, and production ended in 2011.",
            "Power for this SL55 comes from a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine, which produces 493 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque when left stock. RennTech pegs its output at 538 horsepower and 566 lb-ft of torque with the R1 Performance package installed, and the airbox bumps those figures to 548 and 581, respectively.

These had big power (310 horses) but REALLY big torque (553 lb-ft) and they could pull practically anything; at 132,000 miles, this one is relatively lower-mileage than most V10 Touareg models I see. It's still quite an amazing thing to behold \u2013 a relic from an era when Volkswagen made some really impressive, unusual, but car enthusiast-friendly decisions with its products.",

            "Service records included in the gallery list most of the maintenance and repairs performed on this Touareg during the 2010s. The driveshaft was replaced in June 2020, 3 brake vacuum lines were changed in October 2019, and new front upper control arms were installed in December 2016. The engine was replaced with a new unit by a Volkswagen dealer at about 45,000 miles in February 2010. The seller states the previous owner damaged the original engine while attempting to drive through a flood.",
            "Volkswagen introduced the Touareg, its first modern SUV, for the 2004 model year. Part of the brand's upmarket push, it was related to the original Porsche Cayenne, and it was marketed as a true off-roader packed with luxury features; many compared it to the Land Rover Range Rover. It could cross rivers, tow a boat, or cruise on the highway for hours on end. The V10 TDI-powered model was positioned at the top of the Touareg range in the United States, where the mighty W12 engine was never available.",
            "Power for this Touareg comes from a 5.0-liter V10 TDI turbodiesel engine, which produces 310 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. It spins the 4 wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission and Volkswagen's 4Motion permanent all-wheel-drive system, and it gives the Touareg a pickup-like 7,700-pound towing capacity."

Over the past year, it has received an extensive list of modifications, including a Garrett VNT17 turbo, a 6-speed manual transmission from a 2011 Volkswagen Jetta, plus all-wheel drive parts, a floor pan, and other bits and pieces from a first-generation Audi TT. The full list of modifications made to this New Beetle is below.",

Initially offered as a hatchback, and later available as a convertible, the New Beetle was based on the fourth-generation Golf and offered with gasoline- and diesel-powered engines. It was an instant hit that became Volkswagen's second-best-selling model the year it was released. It was replaced by the Beetle in 2011.",
            "The only all-wheel-drive New Beetle available from the factory was the high-performance RSi, which was limited to 250 units globally. All other variants were front-wheel drive.",

The seller pegs its current output at approximately 200 horsepower, but no dyno sheet was provided to confirm this figure. It spins the 4 wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission and drivetrain parts from Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system."

As a result, a '98 or '99 model is the one you want, but they're tremendously hard to find, especially in this condition.

If you want a Raptor that will blow the other Raptors away \u2013 without paying big money for a new one \u2013 this truck is precisely what you're looking for.

It was extremely capable off the beaten path, a claim many trucks can make, but it could also drive flat-out on uneven surfaces. Pegging the Raptor at the intersection of drag racing and overlanding made it in an instant hit.",

For context, an unmodified 2013 Raptor uses a naturally-aspirated V8 that makes 411 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. The engine spins the 4 wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission, a 2-speed transfer case, and a locking rear differential."

The S4 was positioned a notch above the standard A4 as a quicker, sportier sedan that nonetheless remained luxurious.",

The Z8 also became an icon thanks to its engine, shared with the contemporary E39 M5, and its appearance in James Bond's car in the 1999 film, \"The World is Not Enough.\" Coupled with a 6-speed manual transmission in the standard Z8, an all-aluminum chassis and body, and bespoke Z8 features, it's no wonder the Z8 has been heralded by enthusiasts as one of the most interesting and unique BMWs in the company's history.",
