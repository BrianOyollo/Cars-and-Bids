Not only is it an ex-military model titled for road use, it's a Slantback model \u2013 which was never really offered in civilian trim. More amazingly, this Humvee features full body and undercarriage armor (!) along with a ring-mounted turret, energy absorbing seats, air conditioning, and much more \u2013 and as a result, it's FAR more impressive and amazing than the vast majority of ex-military Humvees. Of course, this Humvee also comes with 4-wheel drive, portal axles, and a Turbodiesel V8 \u2013 and it's finished in military-style matte camouflage, which is accentuated by a set of awesome 16-inch 2-piece wheels.

This 230GE is a Puch-badged G-Wagen that was reportedly built for the Swiss Army, and it's titled in the United States, so the hard work of sourcing a car from abroad and bringing it here has already been completed. This G is powered by a gasoline engine and it's fitted with an automatic transmission, so it's easier to drive daily than a manual transmission model, and it touts a cool removable soft top that turns it into a full convertible. The folding rear bench seats are a nice feature to have, as well.",

It was released in 1979 and aimed largely at farmers and adventurers; Beverly Hills wasn't on the company's radar yet. The G's upmarket ascent started when the extensively updated W463 arrived in 1990. It looked a lot like the original G, but it gained a longer list of features and a permanent four-wheel-drive system. Units sold in Austria, Switzerland, and some markets in Eastern Europe were marketed by the Puch brand, though these trucks were nearly identical to their Mercedes-Benz-badged counterparts.",

Called M102 internally, and shared with several Mercedes-Benz models from the 1980s and 1990s, it spins the rear or the four wheels via a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 2-speed transfer case."

This one has the robust 3.0-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine, a cool, power-operated rear parking mirror, AND a useful multi-information display above the windshield. It's also very nearly unmodified, it touts low indicated mileage, and it's offered with a clean, accident-free CAR VX report \u2013 all very desirable benefits! Green and silver over gray is an attractive color combination, too \u2013 and this Hilux Surf is titled in the United States, so the time-consuming task of importing a vehicle from abroad has already been completed.",

            "This is a right-hand drive, Japanese-market SUV that's titled in New Hampshire. It's equipped with a metric instrument cluster and its odometer displays about 40,000 kilometers, which represents approximately 24,900 miles.",
            "The CAR VX report shown in the gallery indicates no accidents or mileage discrepancies in this SUV's past.",
            "Factory equipment includes an adjustable suspension system, skid plates, side steps, a power-operated rear parking mirror, cloth upholstery, a multi-information display, and air conditioning. Modifications reported by the selling dealer are limited to aftermarket trim on the front bumper, aftermarket rear mudflaps, and an Eclipse cassette and CD player.",
            "Known as the Hilux Surf in Japan, the third-generation Toyota 4Runner launched in 1995 as the popularity of SUVs ballooned on both sides of the Pacific. It shared its basic proportions with its predecessor but it was new from the ground up and slightly longer. And, while it was nicer and better-suited to family-hauling duties inside, it retained body-on-frame construction and remained exceptionally capable off-road. Japanese buyers had access to several options not offered here, including a turbodiesel engine (which this truck is equipped with). Production ended in 2002.",
            "Power comes from a 3.0-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine, rated at about 130 horsepower and 213 lb-ft of torque. It spins the rear or the four wheels via a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 2-speed transfer case."
