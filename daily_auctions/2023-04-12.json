This particular FD RX-7 is a Japanese-market Type R model produced under the upscale \u025b\u0303fini brand, and it's equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, along with some nice upgrades like an aftermarket cat-back exhaust, TEIN coilovers, an aftermarket hood and side skirts, and 16-inch Enkei wheels. This RX-7 has also been repainted in gorgeous Violet Pearl, and it benefits from having very low mileage for its age. Other benefits include a clean, accident-free Japanese Car VX vehicle history report along with a U.S. title \u2013 the latter of which means that the next owner won't have to worry about the difficulty of importing one from abroad.",

Hot hatches were hugely popular in the 1980s, but the Isuzu I-Mark RS Turbo was one of the more obscure entries into the segment \u2013 this is the first one that we've listed since launching Cars & Bids nearly three years ago! It looks like it's been well-kept: it's finished in a head-turning shade of red, it's very nearly unmodified, and it boasts reasonable mileage for a 35-year-old car. The accident-free Carfax report is another big benefit, and I think the body kit suits the boxy design pretty well. This is the kind of car that's sure to spark a conversation everywhere you go \u2013 be prepared to answer questions like \"What's an I-Mark?\" and \"What does Lotus have to do with it?\" every time you get gas.

With a 6-speed manual transmission, a 236-horsepower V6, a limited-slip differential, and a Bilstein suspension system, it should offer a fun driving experience while still providing the utility of a truck. This particular X-Runner is also finished in a stunning (and rare) color called Barcelona Red Metallic, and it features a few nice upgrades like 20-inch Rohana wheels and a custom tonneau bed cover.
