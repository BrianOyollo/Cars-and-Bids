The drivetrain is the same, though, which is a good thing \u2013 since that means you get a potent turbocharged 4-cylinder and Subaru's excellent all-wheel drive system. This particular 9-2X boasts a desirable 5-speed manual transmission, and it features some desirable upgrades intended to improve its performance and handling like 17-inch Enkei RPF1 wheels, a COBB Tuning Stage 1 tune, a WRX STi top-mount intercooler, an Invidia 3-inch catback exhaust, and an aftermarket lowering kit.
