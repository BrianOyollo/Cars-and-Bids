Part of the brand's upmarket push, it was related to the original Porsche Cayenne, and it was marketed as a true off-roader packed with luxury features.

        "dougs_take": "The Bentley Azure is a gorgeous grand touring convertible that offers an opulent interior, stately styling, and vast amounts of power from its 6.75-liter turbocharged V8. This particular Azure is famously owned by Hoovie's Garage, who touts it as an amazing luxury bargain that can be had for only a fraction of its original sticker price \u2013 a sticker price that was once paid by actor Jean-Claude Van Damme, who reportedly owned this car new. This Azure is finished in a stunning Dark Sapphire Metallic over Magnolia color combination, and it boasts some great equipment, including 18-inch wheels, a power-operated soft top, and an interior that's appointed with beautiful materials. Plus, this Azure benefits from some recent servicing and a clean, accident-free Carfax report, for added peace of mind \u2013 AND it's offered with the thrill of no reserve, so it should be a fun auction to watch and participate in!",

            "This Azure is owned by YouTuber Tyler Hoover. Its purchase and some of the repairs performed to it were documented in a series of videos that can be viewed below. It was also reportedly owned by the actor Jean-Claude Van Damme.",
            "Factory equipment includes 18-inch wheels, dual front brake calipers, a power-folding soft top, power-adjustable and heated front seats with memory function, push-button start, and cruise control. The only modification reported by the selling dealer is an Alpine head unit.",
            "The first-generation Azure brought a \"land yacht\" convertible into Bentley's model lineup when it was first introduced in 1995. Effectively a soft top version of the Continental R, the Azure offered a sportier driving experience without diluting the uncompromised luxury that the Bentley nameplate was known for. This culminated in a starting MSRP of well over $300,000 back when the Azure was new.",
            "Power comes from a 6.75-liter turbocharged V8, rated at approximately 400 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Output is sent to the rear wheels via a 4-speed automatic transmission."
