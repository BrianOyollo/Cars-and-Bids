Over the years the WRX has built a reputation for itself as an all-weather performance machine due to its symmetrical all-wheel-drive system. In 2015, the WRX was split off from the base Impreza and rebooted as a standalone model. With this change came a number of styling changes and chassis tweaks to further accentuate the WRX and STI's sportiness. Production ended in 2021.",

It drew inspiration from the WRX STI race car that won its class in the 2019 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring, as evidenced by features such as a wide-body kit, an upgraded turbocharger, a carbon fiber roof panel, and a massive rear wing.
