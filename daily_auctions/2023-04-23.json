The 997-generation Porsche 911 Turbo is already a fantastic sports car, but this one has been modified to resemble a GT2 inside and out \u2013 with a GT2-style body kit and GT2-style interior details. A LOT of weight has been trimmed off as well, thanks to a rear-wheel drive conversion, a sunroof delete, the addition of a carbon fiber roof, front and rear polycarbonate windows, and a rear seat delete. There's some great factory equipment, too, including the Sport Chrono Package Plus, xenon headlights, adaptive heated front sport seats, and a Bose high end sound system.

The Turbo became available in 2007 and was noticeably wider than the base 997. Variable-geometry turbos help to drastically reduce turbo lag, and better stability, suspension, and all-wheel drive make this a daily-driveable high-performance sportscar.

            "Introduced for the 1994 model year, the SN95 generation of the iconic Ford Mustang replaced the long-running Fox Body Mustang and introduced some classic styling cues to the car. It was available in convertible and fastback coupe body styles, and it featured improved handling, a revised interior, and a wide range of V6 and V8 engines. The platform received a significant aesthetic facelift in 1999 with Ford's \"New Edge\" design language adding more sharp edges than previous years' soft curves; production ended in 2004.",

It's also equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, 13-inch wheels with wheel covers, AND the factory AM/FM/cassette stereo system, which is really cool since most radios from this era have been swapped out for aftermarket units. This Civic is also offered with a clean, accident-free Carfax report, for added peace of mind \u2014 and the thrill of no reserve should make this an exciting auction to watch.",

Similar to its predecessor, the R56 Mini GP had the rear seats removed (with a brace taking their place), and gained a lowered suspension, a more powerful engine, and a special body kit to help it stand out.",

This engine may be making more power as a result of the modifications, though a dyno sheet was not provided to confirm. Output is directed to all four wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission."
