This is a one-owner car that features a LONG list of modifications (one of the longest I've ever seen on Cars & Bids!) intended to improve performance, handling, and style \u2013 there's not a lot left on this car that still carries a Mitsubishi part number, and the result is an output of 472 horsepower at the wheels, which is a major increase over the stock figure. This Evo also boasts a 5-speed manual transmission, and it benefits from a documented engine overhaul performed at about 58,600 miles \u2013 this should give bidders a tremendous amount of peace of mind. It looks like a lot of resources went into this build, and I'm sure the next owner will have a lot of fun with it.",

It gained a new, more powerful engine, a revised suspension system, and a design inspired by sharks and fighter jets, according to the company. MR denoted an automatic transmission; stick-shifted variants were called GSR. Mitsubishi canceled the Lancer Evolution in 2016, and it all but confirmed the model will not return in the foreseeable future.",
            "Power comes from a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, rated at 291 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque when left stock. The modifications increase those figures to about 472 and 360, respectively, at the wheels, according to a dyno sheet pictured in the gallery. The engine spins the four wheels via a 5-speed manual transmission."

Penned by Bertone, the X1/9 came with a removable targa top that could be stored in the frunk, and while it didn\u2019t offer the big power its wedge shape left you to believe, it quickly gained the \u201cbaby Ferrari\u201d nickname due to its excitement when dealing with corners.

It boasts a 2.0-liter flat-4 that's twin-turbocharged to about 280 horsepower, which is a big number \u2013 and it touts a U.S. title for peace of mind. Other benefits include all-wheel drive and several desirable modifications including aftermarket coilovers and Enkei wheels. I also love the fact that this wagon's exterior design remains relatively subtle; only the most hardcore enthusiasts will know that it's approaching Golf R power \u2013 and no reserve makes this fast wagon even more appealing.",

Front-wheel drive came standard, and all-wheel drive was offered at an extra cost. Its main claim to fame is spawning the original Outback, which gave Subaru's American sales a considerable boost. Production ended in 1999, and Subaru never sold the GT-B model on our shores.",

Mercedes-Benz built around 2,600 G-Class Cabriolet models with a power-operated convertible top \u2013 I've owned one for almost four years, and I consider it one of the very best vehicles I've ever owned. Now, here's another one: a 1997 G320 Cabriolet, which features 4-wheel drive, Mercedes-Benz's reliable M104 3.2-liter 6-cylinder engine, and that all-important power top. There are only about 120 of these here in the United States, and this G is already located in the U.S. and titled here, so you don't have to go through the trouble of importing it. It also boasts some minor modifications and triple-locking differentials that help the G achieve its famous off-roading capabilities. I truly love this car, and I'll be jealous of whoever ends up with this one!",

            "Mercedes-Benz joined forces with Steyr-Daimler-Puch to create the original G-Class (W460). It was released in 1979 and aimed largely at farmers and adventurers; Beverly Hills wasn't on the company's radar yet. The G's upmarket ascent started when the extensively updated W463 arrived in 1990. It looked a lot like the original G, but it gained a longer list of features and a permanent four-wheel-drive system. American sales officially started for the 2003 model year and civilian production ended in 2018. The convertible model, which was never imported to the United States by Mercedes-Benz, retired in 2014.",

This Fox Body now makes an impressive 398 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque at the rear wheels!

This is a post-facelift M5 that's finished in Titanium Silver Metallic, which always works well on the E39 \u2013 and it features a handsome two-tone interior with \"Strauss\" leather seat inserts. This M5 also touts some desirable upgrades, including an aFe POWER Stage 2 intake, a Shark Injector engine ECU tune, and MagnaFlow stainless steel mufflers. This M5 further benefits from good recent service history, along with ownership primarily in dry-climate Southern California, enhancing its appeal even further.",

            "BMW gave the M5 a facelift in 2001. It added the now-famous \"Halo\" headlights, Celis rear lights, redesigned fog lights, a new-look steering wheel, gray instrument gauges, and a 16:9 navigation display, among other features.",

            "Launched in America as a 2004 model, the Phaeton embodied the upmarket shift masterminded by former Volkswagen Group chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch. It was built on the same basic platform as the Bentley Continental Flying Spur, and it was unabashedly positioned as the flagship of the Volkswagen brand. Although it was an excellent sedan by most period accounts, it failed to excite consumers in the United States, and sales ended after the 2006 model year. Most sources peg American sales in the vicinity of 3,000 units, and less than 500 of those were equipped with the W12 engine, according to VW Vortex.",

It was originally offered exclusively with a 4-cylinder engine, but 6-cylinder-powered models were quickly added to the range.

It's turning 20 in 2023, and it's starting to become increasingly desired by enthusiasts \u2013 and values have gone up in recent years. This Gallardo LP640-4 Spyder is a later model, so it benefits from the updates that Lamborghini made during the production run, and it boasts some great equipment including a front-axle lift system that will certainly be very useful \u2013 and, of course, a convertible top. It also touts relatively low mileage, it's finished in an eye-catching shade of red, AND it's pretty much unmodified.

It also touts some nice equipment like the Premium and Cold Weather packages, and its only modification is an M Sport shift knob.

The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X was quick even when left stock, but this one features over $60,000 in modifications intended to improve performance and handling. It notably received a new engine in 2021, which is a major benefit, and it's equipped with an aftermarket turbo and stronger rear axles. It's also been dyno-tuned to 757 horsepower, which is over twice the factory output! The clean, accident-free Carfax report is a huge benefit (a lot of similar builds start with a salvaged car), and this Evo also touts the 5-speed manual transmission that enhances the driving experience. It looks like a lot of resources went into building this Evo, and I'm happy to see it on Cars & Bids.",

            "Mitsubishi's 10th and final Lancer Evolution arrived for 2008. It gained a new, more powerful engine, a revised suspension system, and a design inspired by sharks and fighter jets, according to the company. MR denoted an automatic transmission; stick-shifted variants were called GSR. Mitsubishi canceled the Lancer Evolution in 2016, and it all but confirmed the model will not return in the foreseeable future.",

The modifications increase those figures to 757 and 522, respectively, when the engine burns E85 fuel, according to a dyno sheet pictured in the gallery. The engine spins the four wheels via a 5-speed manual transmission."
