This SS also features some great factory equipment, namely Magnetic Ride Control, Brembo brakes, and a limited-slip differential \u2013 and it has some relatively minor modifications, added mostly to enhance its look and braking performance.

Chevrolet gave the SS a minor face-lift for 2016, which brought revised front-end lighting, a dual-mode exhaust, red Brembo brake calipers, and an updated wheel design. Approximately 12,906 units of the SS were sent to the United States between the 2014 and 2017 model years, though a handful were sold in 2018.",

Never officially sold in the United States, the SUV was available with two or four doors and it could be ordered with either a gasoline- or a diesel-burning engine. The 90-Series Prado easily outsold the regular Land Cruiser in many overseas markets, and production ended in 2002.",
