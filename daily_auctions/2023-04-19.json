Years in the making, it picked up where British and Italian roadsters left off by offering enthusiasts nimble handling and an open-air driving experience at a relatively affordable price. The first Miata quickly attracted a cult following, and demand far exceeded Mazda's initial expectations. Production ended in 1997, and the NA passed the torch to the NB.",

It was launched as Ferrari's fastest and highest-revving V8-powered production car, and it remained in production until 2015.

It's a Japanese-market G320, but it's left-hand drive, which is a MAJOR benefit! It also boasts a U.S. title, along with a fairly extensive service history \u2013 the transmission was notably overhauled in 2016. This G320 is also mostly unmodified \u2013 though the lift kit is a cool addition! \u2013 and it touts a clean, accident-free Carfax report. Plus, check out the folding, side-facing third-row seats installed in the cargo area \u2013 an awesome and hard-to-find factory option that lets this G320 seat up to 9 passengers!",

It was released in 1979 and aimed largely at farmers and adventurers; Beverly Hills wasn't on the company's radar yet. The G's upmarket ascent started when the extensively updated W463 arrived in 1990. It looked a lot like the original G, but it gained a longer list of features and a permanent four-wheel drive system. American sales officially started for the 2003 model year and civilian production ended in 2018.",
