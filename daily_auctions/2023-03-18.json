This is a truly special car \u2013 a limited-edition version of the \"normal\" CLK63 AMG that was extensively modified for high-performance driving. It touts factory upgrades such as an aggressive body kit, a revised suspension system, and AMG's famous 6.2-liter V8 engine tuned to output 500 horsepower \u2013 and the steering and handling is truly fantastic. If you're in the market for one, this appears to be a spectacular example, with minimal modifications, mostly warm-climate ownership, and a mere 10,000 miles on the odometer. In addition, this CLK63 Black Series comes with a clean, accident-free Carfax report, for added peace of mind. I'm proud to offer this CLK63 AMG Black Series on Cars & Bids, and I'll be extremely jealous of its next owner.",

While the coupe shared a name and some styling cues with the regular CLK, it was a much more hardcore model whose design drew inspiration from the Formula One safety car. AMG fitted a 500-horsepower V8, flared wheel arches, and an adjustable suspension system, among other updates. Most historians agree that less than 700 units were built globally.",

This particular H2 however is particularly special, as it's a rare pickup-backed SUT version. It also boasts some nice factory equipment, including a locking rear differential, heated front and rear seats, and a sunroof. Other benefits include a number of mostly visual modifications, and a clean, accident-free Carfax report showing ownership mostly in warm-weather California, further adding to the appeal.",

            "Released for the 2003 model year, the Hummer H2 was smaller than the war-bred H1 but it nonetheless dwarfed nearly everything else on the road. It was a burly, body-on-frame off-roader with a 40-degree approach angle and nearly 10 inches of ground clearance. The boxy body hid tried-and-true parts borrowed from Chevrolet's Suburban and Tahoe SUVs that were modified for off-road use.",
            "The SUT variant featured GM's innovative \"Midgate\" configuration, which can extend the bed into the passenger compartment for added utility. Matched with the H2's standard off-road prowess, the SUT had the capabilities to match its brawny, outsized proportions.",

That's because it has an engine and transmission swap from an E39 BMW M5, which basically turns this car into the \"M7\" that was never built. It also includes a LOT of additional modifications to enhance the driving experience and look \u2014 namely, an upgraded suspension system, an aftermarket exhaust, and an Alpina front spoiler. This E38 is also based on the the famed \"Sporty Shorty\" short-wheelbase M Sport model, which has become increasingly desirable.

This Pajero Evo is also mostly unmodified, which is a nice touch \u2013 and I think the Enkei wheels suit the design well.

It boasts a flat-plane-crank, naturally-aspirated V8 rated at a muscular 670 horsepower, it touts impressive handling, and it's more practical than you might assume because it has two trunks. This Z06 has a lot going for it: it features the range-topping 3LZ trim along with an Adrenaline Red interior, a transparent removable roof panel, AND a front-axle lift system. It's also unmodified \u2013 and with less than 300 miles on the odometer it's pretty much new, so this is your chance to skip the line at the local Chevrolet dealership.",

That means it boasts an unbelievable amount of horsepower thanks to a Hellcat supercharged V8 under the hood, and it features the muscular body panels that makes these trucks so attractive. It's also equipped with some additional upgrades like a custom tune and a Green HD supercharger belt \u2013 and the PCM has been unlocked by HPTuners.

This particular X5 4.8is is especially desirable, as it boasts a relatively low 55,900 miles \u2013 and it has some nice equipment, including heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and a panoramic sunroof. It\u2019s also mechanically unmodified, and the Carfax report shows just two owners and registrations in warm-weather Texas and Washington from new, further adding to the appeal.

In fact, the Niva is so popular that it's still in production over 45 years after its debut. This is a left-hand drive example that touts a U.S. registration for peace of mind. It's also mostly unmodified, which is a great benefit, and it looks like it's been relatively well-kept \u2013 a lot of these were heavily modified, driven hard, or both.

Initially only offered with two doors, it stood out from many comparable SUVs with unibody construction and a full-time four-wheel drive system. It was later made available with four doors, and several third-party companies turned it into a convertible. Lada has made numerous updates to the Niva over the past couple of decades and the model remains available new today in some markets, including Russia. While it was briefly sold in Canada, it was never officially available in the United States.",

        "dougs_take": "I love this! The R55 Mini Clubvan is one of the rarest Mini models in North America, as they sold just 50 cars in the few months that went on sale \u2013 and it's one of the quirkiest vans ever made. This particular Clubvan is also the very same car I reviewed a few years ago, which adds to my excitement for this weird and special Mini. Like all of these, this one is finished in the handsome Pepper White, and it\u2019s fitted with some nice factory features, including roof rails, a split tailgate, and air conditioning. It also has a relatively low 50,600 miles \u2013 and it touts a clean, accident-free Carfax report, showing just two owners in warm-weather California from new, further adding to the appeal. If you always wanted one of the rarest Mini models ever made, this is your chance!",

            "The odometer in this Mini indicates approximately 50,600 miles.",
            "The attached Carfax history report shows no accidents or mileage discrepancies in this Mini's past. It also confirms that this is a 2-owner car registered in California from new.",
            "According to the build sheet provided in the gallery, factory equipment includes 16-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, a multifunction sport leather steering wheel, climate control, rear Park Distance Control, and more as detailed below. Modifications reported by the seller are limited to a rubber trunk liner.",
            "Released for the US market in 2013, the Mini Clubvan was a compact commercial van based on the R55-generation Mini Clubman. The Clubvan retained the third passenger door, but the rear seats were removed to create a flat load floor complete with tie-down points. The rear windows were covered with vinyl from the outside and plastic inserts on the inside. Mini withdrew the Clubvan from the US market in July 2013 due to low demand and the excessive 25% \"Chicken Tax\" in place on light commercial vehicles. Only 50 Clubvans were sold in the U.S. during their short production run.",
            "Power comes from a 1.6-liter inline-4, rated at 121 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Output is sent to the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission."
