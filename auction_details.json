The Corvette Callaway SC757 Coupe is nothing short of an insanely powerful sports car that surely offers up a truly fantastic driving experience, and I'm excited to have our first one on Cars & Bids! Based on the C7 Chevy Corvette, this particular example is finished in gorgeous Laguna Blue \u2013 and it's equipped with a massive supercharged V8 that generates 757 horsepower and 777 lb-ft of torque, which gives lightning-fast acceleration through the 7-speed manual transmission. Handling and grip are also superb, thanks to the adjustable suspension system and massive brakes. This impressive Callaway SC757 also shows less than 12,000 miles, and it's offered with a clean, accident-free Carfax report, for added peace of mind.\u007f",
