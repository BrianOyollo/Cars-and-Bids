Still, the original WRX was never sold in the United States.",

This E30 also features several suspension modifications that should improve handling, including aftermarket shocks and springs \u2013 yet it looks nearly unmodified when viewed from the outside.

The 325e notably joined the line-up for 1984 as the first 6-cylinder-powered E30 sold in the United States, and the 325iX released for 1988 was the first series-produced BMW with permanent all-wheel-drive.

It's also mostly unmodified, which is a great benefit, and it looks like it's been relatively well-kept \u2013 a lot of these were heavily modified, driven hard, or both.

This is a 1.6-liter-powered GTi that's titled in the United States, which is a major benefit \u2013 and it touts an attractive color combination; check out the striped cloth upholstery and red carpets! This 205 GTi also features some modifications, including 15-inch wheels from a newer model, along with a sunroof.

The R55 Mini Clubvan is one of the rarest Mini models in North America, as they sold just 50 cars in the few months that went on sale \u2013 and it's one of the quirkiest vans ever made. This particular Clubvan is also the very same car I reviewed a few years ago, which adds to my excitement for this weird and special Mini. Like all of these, this one is finished in the handsome Pepper White, and it\u2019s fitted with some nice factory features, including roof rails, a split tailgate, and air conditioning. It also has a relatively low 50,600 miles \u2013 and it touts a clean, accident-free Carfax report, showing just two owners in warm-weather California from new, further adding to the appeal.

The rear windows were covered with vinyl from the outside and plastic inserts on the inside.
