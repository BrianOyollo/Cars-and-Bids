It's also been modified with a long list of equipment intended to make life easier off the grid, including solar power, winterized freshwater and gray water tanks, a 300Ah Lithium battery bank, seating for five passengers, eating space for four, a custom memory foam mattress, bamboo-trimmed cabinetry and counter tops, and custom tweed covered walls. The exterior of this van looks fantastic with its Desert Sand Beige wrap and Black Rhino Arsenal wheels, too \u2013 and there's some great factory equipment, like the Low & High Range 4x4 and Driver Convenience packages. On top of all that, this Sprinter is offered with low mileage and a clean, accident-free Carfax report showing dry-climate Southern California ownership from new, providing valuable peace of mind.",

This particular example is a Luxury all-wheel drive model that touts a long list of modifications intended to improve its performance, including the installation of a low mileage LTG short block and several ZZPerformance parts like performance cams, forged pistons, a turbocharger, intercooler, exhaust, drilled and slotted brake rotors, and much more. It features some nice factory equipment, too \u2013 including the Sun and Sound, Cold Weather, and Driver Awareness packages, and 18-inch forged aluminum wheels. This ATS is also offered with a clean, accident-free Carfax report AND with the allure of no reserve, which should make for an exciting auction finish.",

Highlights include a ZZP LTG short block and ZZP LTG Stage 2 performance cams, forged pistons, intercooler kit, LTG ZFR turbocharger, LTG E85 conversion, catted down-pipe, front and rear lower sway bars, trailing arms, and drilled and slotted rear brake rotors.",
            "Introduced for the 2013 model year as Cadillac's entry-level car, the ATS shared the GM Alpha platform with the sixth-generation Chevy Camaro. Cadillac engineers reportedly benchmarked the E46 BMW 3-series during development, and upon release, the ATS was praised by critics for its sharp styling and taut driving dynamics that made the baby Cadillac a serious competitor to more expensive German rivals.",
            "Power comes from a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, rated at 272 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque in stock form, and the selling dealer notes that ZZPerformance estimates that this ATS currently produces approximately 500 horsepower. Output is sent to all four wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission."
